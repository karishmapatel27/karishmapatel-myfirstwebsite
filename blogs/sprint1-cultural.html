              Ethical Decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In my previous job as a beautician, a customer asked me a question regarding the effect of some treatment. I responded
              with an honest answer, my manager was there, and she heard our conversation. I knew my manager would not be happy with
              my response, but I did not want to lie to my customer. Later the manager told me that she was not pleased with my answer
              because she thinks that we may lose the potential client. I understood her point of view that we need to run the
              business, but for me, customer's safety comes first.
            </p>
            <br />
            
            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;">
              My values and Identity
            </p>
            
            <p>
              My culture and my family has played a significant role in my identity and values I have today. Most of the time, people
              around me identify me as an honest person, and that honesty in me comes from my parents. I've always got taught to be
              honest to others as well as to myself. I have always lived away from my parents so, family matters to me most. Due to
              living in different circumstances, I am now more flexible and open to change; whether it is a change in a living
              situation or a change in myself.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;">My Strengths and Limitations</p>
            
            <p>
              One of my strengths is that I am never afraid of learning new things. When I face a challenge, I may take a step back to
              gather myself around, but I do not keep the option of giving up easily. <br> <br>
              I am a people person, but at first, I can come across as a shy person. Once I feel comfortable around people, I do make
              a good connection. I think that my people skills will help me very much when I will be working in the group project and
              also during my career.<br> <br>
              My drive to achieve my goals will really help me in my learning journey. As I mentioned earlier, I may take my time, but
              I do not give up on the task just because it is tough and needs more time and effort to finish it. <br>
              Whatever task I do, I am fully committed to it. I don't enjoy doing some of the stuff, but I do not let that be the
              reason of me delivering a poor quality work. <br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              One of my weakness is that I take a little time getting comfortable around new people. The reason I consider this as my
              weakness is that I have seen so many people who can just interact with anyone, and they have an enormous amount of
              confidence filled in them. <br>
              My other weakness is that I sometimes don't ask for help when I need it. I feel embarrassed, and I try to solve my
              problem on my own. I am working on it, and I continuously remind myself to use the support from people around me.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;">Experience of dealing with resistance</p>
            
            <p>
              I remember an incident from a university where we were working on the project in a group. I was leading my group at that
              time; one of the team members would not show up to group meetings and also wouldn't deliver the assigned work. Instead
              of going to the lecturer and complaining about him, being a leader, I took the responsibility, and I contacted the
              person to find out the reasons. After listening to him and finding his reasons, I arranged a personal meeting with him,
              and we discussed the work strategy, which resources to use, etc. The member showed up to the next meeting, and other
              members of the team provided their support throughout the project. I will use this strategy whenever I work in the group
              because I believe when we work in the team, we empower each other, and there is no place for "I" in the team.
