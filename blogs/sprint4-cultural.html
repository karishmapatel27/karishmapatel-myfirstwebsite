    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
    <br /><br />

    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;">
      Neuroplasticity
    </p>

    <p>
        Often we hold ourselves back thinking it is hard to change our brain, learn something new, or change our habits but,
        understanding the principle of neuroplasticity helps us break these beliefs. It helps us realise that we can improve our
        brain, which breaks many boundaries for us. It helps us from giving up and ultimately helps us reach our goals. 
        <br>
        To increase my brain's neuroplasticity, I will not follow the same routine every day. I will exercise, eat healthy food
        and get 8 hours of sleep. I will learn a new piece of information every day. I will practice what I learn to help retain
        the information. I will try to engage my brain to it's best capacity. 
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;">
      What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity
    </p>
    <p>
        You can encourage neuroplasticity through your healthy lifestyle habits. Such as: <br>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Sleep - It's essential so that our brain can function to its optimum level.
          </li>
          <li>Exercise - Promotes the birth and preservation of new brain cells. </li>
          <li>Make your mental health a priority - take the required actions to decrease stress. </li>
          <li>Fasting - intermittent fasting help increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level. </li>
          <li>Seek novelty - getting out of your comfort zone, trying something new, not following the same routine every day helps
            build new neural pathways in our brain. </li>
          <li>Learning - whether it is learning a new language or instrument, learning also helps increase neuroplasticity. 
          </li>
        </ol>  
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;">Growth Mindset</p>

    <p>
        A "Fixed mind" person assumes that intelligence, the creative ability can not be changed. They correlate success with
        intelligence and failure as unintelligence. While a "Growth mindset" enjoys challenges and relates failures to a
        learning curve. <br>
        We operate in both fixed and growth mindset but what we hold has an immense amount of effect on our learning
        abilities. A person with a fixed mindset will not be encouraged to improve their skills and would give up on the task
        very quickly. In contrast, growth mindset person will continually try to improve their ability, develop new skills, and
        are not afraid of leaning. A person with a growth mindset works hard to improve their skills and has a more chance of
        becoming successful in their life. Growing mindset person will value the process regardless of its outcome. <br> <br>
        This topic is not new to me. I remember myself from ten years ago, where I give up when things don't come to me quickly. I used to think that I am an average student, and I can never get an A in my studies. With time, I decided to invest in myself and make myself a better person every day. I may initially feel overwhelmed or scared, but I understand that failure is a part of the learning process, and it is not a bad thing. I am a different person than I was then, and this is a long ongoing journey for me. <br> <br>
