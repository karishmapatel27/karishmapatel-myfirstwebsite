    <h1>Learning Reflections</h1>
    <p>
      My long term goal
      <br />
      <br />
      In the next five years, I see myself working as a senior full-stack
      developer as well as in the management role where I get to manage a small
      team.
      <br /><br /><br />

      Non-technical skills I would you like to see developed while at EDA?
      <br /><br />
      While studying at EDA, I want to work on my soft skills such as
      communication; whether is with seniors or teammates. I want to develop my
      leadership, team-work (collaboration) and decision-making skills.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      My Strengths <br /><br />
      From a very young age, I have developed a significant amount of interest
      in drawing, design, etc. I like to improve the aesthetics of things, for
      example, making a PPT slides look more fun and colourful, drawing a design
      on a simple card, etc., so I consider creativity as one of my strengths.
      <br />I am not afraid of continuous learning, I am 27, and I am still
      learning new skills, this course is one of the examples. I like to learn
      new things every day, and it is not just related to study, but learning to
      make a new recipe, meeting a new people and learn about their life, small
      DIY project, and much more stuff.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      My Limitations
      <br />
      <br />One of my weakness is public speaking. I still remember my 1st
      presentation at the university where I just read my script from the paper
      while maintaining the minimum eye contact. Over the few years, I have
      improved a little bit but, I am not where I want to be yet. <br />I find
      this embarrassing, but I am not a very creative person when it comes to
      writing, I have always struggled with essays in school and university.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      How I manage my workload<br /><br />
      When it comes to productivity and time management, I like to use both apps
      and a physical planner. To keep myself from getting distracted, I keep my
      workstation clear and use the Pomodoro technique. I set the time on my
      browser, so I get notified every 25 minutes. I use a physical planner
      where I jot down all the task which I need to finish; I do this a night
      before. <br />
      If I struggle with any topic, I will google more resources on the same
      topic to get a better understanding. If that doesnâ€™t solve my problem,
      then I would ask for help from my peers or facilitator.
      <br /><br /><br />

      Seeking help<br /><br />
      As I mentioned above, If I ever get stuck, I will first ask for help from
      fellow students and then my facilitator and not leave the work for the
      last minutes. <br /><br /><br />

      Expectation from the facilitation team<br /><br />
      I hope to receive support and encouragement from my facilitator, and
      provide guidance when I get stuck with a problem. I also expect to receive
      an honest and constructive criticism on the work I submit. <br />
