              <dt>My long term goal</dt>
              <br />
              <dd>
                In the next five years, I see myself working as a senior
                full-stack developer as well as in the management role where I
                get to manage a small team.
              </dd>
              <br />

              <dt>
                Non-technical skills I would you like to see developed while at
                EDA?
              </dt>
              <br />
              <dd>
                While studying at EDA, I want to work on my soft skills such as
                communication; whether is with seniors or teammates. I want to
                develop my leadership, team-work (collaboration) and
                decision-making skills.
              </dd>
              <br />
              <dt>My Strengths</dt>

              <br />
              <dd>
                From a very young age, I have developed a significant amount of
                interest in drawing, design, etc. I like to improve the
                aesthetics of things, for example, making a PPT slides look more
                fun and colourful, drawing a design on a simple card, etc., so I
                consider creativity as one of my strengths.
              </dd>

              <br />
              <dd>
                I am not afraid of continuous learning, I am 27, and I am still
                learning new skills, this course is one of the examples. I like
                to learn new things every day, and it is not just related to
                study, but learning to make a new recipe, meeting a new people
                and learn about their life, small DIY project, and much more
                stuff.
              </dd>

              <dt>My Limitations</dt>

              <br />
              <dd>
                One of my weakness is public speaking. I still remember my 1st
                presentation at the university where I just read my script from
                the paper while maintaining the minimum eye contact. Over the
                few years, I have improved a little bit but, I am not where I
                want to be yet.
              </dd>
              <br />
              <dd>
                I find this embarrassing, but I am not a very creative person
                when it comes to writing, I have always struggled with essays in
                school and university.
              </dd>
              <br />

              <dt>
                How I manage my workload
              </dt>
              <br />
              <dd>
                When it comes to productivity and time management, I like to use
                both apps and a physical planner. To keep myself from getting
                distracted, I keep my workstation clear and use the Pomodoro
                technique. I set the time on my browser, so I get notified every
                25 minutes. I use a physical planner where I jot down all the
                task which I need to finish; I do this a night before.
              </dd>
              <br />
              <dd>
                If I struggle with any topic, I will google more resources on
                the same topic to get a better understanding. If that doesn’t
                solve my problem, then I would ask for help from my peers or
                facilitator.
              </dd>

              <br />
              <dt>Seeking help</dt>

              <br />
              <dd>
                As I mentioned above, If I ever get stuck, I will first ask for
                help from fellow students and then my facilitator and not leave
                the work for the last minutes.
              </dd>
              <br />
              <dt>Expectation from the facilitation team</dt>
              <br />
              <dd>
                I hope to receive support and encouragement from my facilitator,
                and provide guidance when I get stuck with a problem. I also
                expect to receive an honest and constructive criticism on the
                work I submit.
              </dd>
